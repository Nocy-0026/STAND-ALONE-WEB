# STAND-ALONE-WEB
This project involved a complete redesign and rebuild of the Capaciti website with a clear mission: to transform it into a modern, user-focused digital experience.

ðŸ”§ We developed the platform as a fully standalone website, removing previous dependencies and giving it a stronger, more flexible technical foundation. The focus was not just on how it looks â€” but how it works for real users.

âœ¨ Key Highlights:

Intuitive User Experience: Clean, responsive design that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile.

Performance-Driven Architecture: Rebuilt from the ground up for speed, scalability, and maintainability.

Human-Centered Design: Every element was rethought with the end-user in mind, making navigation simple and meaningful.

End-to-End Execution: From wireframes and UI/UX to full-stack development and deployment.
